- All code, comments, signatures, documentation, and tests must be written in English.
- Always import namespaces.
- Take inspiration from the codebase.
- Avoid one letter or ambiguous variable names.
- Don't create a variable if it's used only once.
- Comments start with a capital letter and end with a period.
- Use space between control structures for readability.
- Run `php vendor/bin/pint --parallel` to format code whenever you finish a change.
- Prefer generating code through Artisan commands to stay up to date with the latest changes.
- Use helper functions instead of Facades if available. E.g., `session()` instead of `Session::get()`.
- Use Real-Time Facades in tests to mock something pulled from the container.
- Always log via the `Log` facade or helper and favor structured context instead of concatenated strings.
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, personally identifiable information).
- Custom Artisan commands must follow Laravel naming and signature conventions.
