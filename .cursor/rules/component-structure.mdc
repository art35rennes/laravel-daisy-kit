  - `partials/`: reusable UI fragments

- Components follow Atomic Design principles (see `atomic-design.mdc`).
- Use the `daisy::` Blade namespace for all components.
- Layouts and templates should only use `ui/*` components—no duplication is allowed. Extract a new component if code is reused.
- Place components by functional purpose, not Atomic Design level.

**Template structure**
- Reusable templates (auth, errors): in both `templates/{category}/` and `components/templates/{category}/` (for Blade component aliases)
- Example templates (layouts, profile, communication): in `templates/{category}/` only, not as components
- See `atomic-design.mdc` for additional template rules.

### Template placement and usage

- All templates are in `resources/views/templates/{category}/{name}.blade.php`.
- Types of templates:
  - **Reusable/stable templates** (ex: `auth/*`, `error`, `empty-state`, `loading-state`, `maintenance`)
    - Also registered as Blade components under `components/templates/{category}/{name}.blade.php`
    - Usable as components (`<x-daisy::templates.auth.login-simple>`) and classic views
    - API is stable, intended for direct re-use
  - **Example templates** (ex: `layout/*`, `communication/*`, `changelog`, `profile/*`)
    - Not Blade components; used only as views (`view('daisy::templates.layout.grid')`)
    - Provided as reference; copy/adapt as needed
