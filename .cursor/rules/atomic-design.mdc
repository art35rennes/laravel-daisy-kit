# Atomic Design - Principles

This package follows Atomic Design principles to organize components into 5 hierarchical levels.

## The 5 levels

1. **ATOMS**: Basic elements with no dependencies on other UI components
2. **MOLECULES**: Simple combinations of multiple atoms
3. **ORGANISMS**: Complex combinations of molecules and/or atoms
4. **TEMPLATES**: Page structures using organisms
5. **PAGES**: Template instances with real content (outside this package)

## Fundamental rules

### Strict hierarchy
- Atoms → depend on nothing
- Molecules → depend only on atoms
- Organisms → depend on molecules/atoms
- Templates → depend on organisms/molecules/atoms

### No duplication
- If code is duplicated, extract a reusable component at the appropriate level

### Logical placement
- Components are placed by functional category, not by Atomic Design level
- Example: a chat component (molecule or organism) goes in `communication/`, not in `advanced/`

### Maximum reuse
- Always check if a component exists before creating a new one
- Prefer composition over duplication

### Limited complexity
- If a component exceeds ~150 lines or contains too much logic, decompose it


#### Templates

- A template should only depend on `x-daisy::layout.*` or `x-daisy::ui.*` components
- A template must never include another template component (`x-daisy::templates.*` is forbidden)
- Always clarify intent: stable reusable (with Blade alias) or example/reference (view only)

## Quick check

Before creating/modifying a component:
1. What level? (atom/molecule/organism/template)
2. Is there duplication? → Extract a component
3. Logical placement? (functional category)
4. Too complex? → Decompose
5. If template: Is it reusable or example? → Follow appropriate rules
