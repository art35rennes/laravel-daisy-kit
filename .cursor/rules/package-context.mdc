- This repository is a **Laravel package**, not an application. All evolutions must respect Laravel package structure (no application logic, no migrations/conflicts with the host application).
- Only compatibility with the current development version is required; no backward compatibility is necessary.
- All classes and components must comply with daisyUI v5 and Tailwind CSS v4.
- Never add custom CSS classes or Tailwind configuration beyond what exists in the host project package.
- Blade namespace: `daisy::`.
- Component structure: organize by functional categories in `resources/views/components/ui/{category}/` (inputs, navigation, layout, data-display, overlay, media, feedback, communication, utilities, advanced, partials).
- Components follow Atomic Design principles (see `atomic-design.mdc`).
- Layout and templates must consume `ui/*` components (no duplication).
- When creating/modifying components: check for existing similar components, prioritize reuse, extract reusable components if duplication exists.
- Placement: functional category, not Atomic Design level.
- Use only `blade-ui-kit/blade-icons` and installed collections. Never add inline SVG in package source code.
- Demo pages: `resources/dev/views/demo/*`, publishable via `daisy-dev-views` tag.
- Documentation pages: `resources/dev/views/docs/*` (see `documentation.mdc`).
- Front sources publishable via `daisy-src` tag.
- Prioritize factorization, reactive Blade props usage, clarity.
- PHPDoc: See `documentation.mdc` for strict requirements.
