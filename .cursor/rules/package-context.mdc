- This repository is a **Laravel package**, not an application. All evolutions must respect Laravel package structure (no application logic, no migrations/conflicts with the host application).
- All classes and components must comply with daisyUI v5 and Tailwind CSS v4.
- Never add custom CSS classes or Tailwind configuration beyond what exists in the host project package.
- Blade namespace: `daisy::`.
- Component structure: organize by categories in `resources/views/components/ui/{category}/` (inputs, navigation, layout, data-display, overlay, media, feedback, utilities, advanced, partials).
- Layout and partials components must consume `ui/*` components (no implementation duplication).
- When creating or modifying a UI component, systematically check for similar components in `resources/views/components/ui/`: prioritize reuse over duplication.
- Use only `blade-ui-kit/blade-icons` and installed collections. Never add inline SVG in package source code.
- Demo/docs pages under `resources/dev/views/demo/*`, publishable via `daisy-dev-views` tag for documentation.
- Front sources publishable via `daisy-src` tag.
- Prioritize factorization, reactive Blade props usage, clarity.
- Comments: PHPDoc/JSDoc useful only (rationale, invariants, edge cases). Avoid obvious comments.
